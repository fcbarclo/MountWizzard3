## Setup my gear in the backyard

### My basic working gear: 10micron GM1000HPS, TLAPO102, QSI690WSG8

Now lets do it step by step:

First I have a fixed pier in my backyard. It's done some month ago and consists of a concrete base (below the grass)
0,8 X 0,8 x 1,0 meters. I put a cover on top of that pier as long as I'm not using it.

On top of the pier, which is a steel one, filled with quartz sand, I have the adaptor plate (1) fixed for the mount. I do not
remove this adaptor plate.

Photo from the top. The orientation is done to the north. The error is about 1-2 degrees and within the range, which can be
adjusted by the mount environment.

You could adjust the leveling by turning the bolt and nut.

The mount computer is located in an aluminium case which is split into two parts. The upper part (1) holds the mount computer,
ethernet switch, USB device server and small embedded PC, the lower part (2) hold a small battery, the relay board, power
supply with DC/DC converters, fuses and switches.

Than I need some more parts: the screws for the mount on top of the adaptor plate, a GPS receiver (I'm still using my good old
Garmin, which has an NEMA interface on the back)

<img src="./pics/IMG_0115.png"/>

Next is the rig which has a big handle on top. With this handle you can take the whole setup with on hand for transportation.
The rig is done with 2 long (360mm) aluminium plates with two clamps between them.

On top I have my starizona motor focus controller.

At the back the image train with QSI690WSG8, a reducer 0x79 linked to the 2,5 inch feather touch focuser. The whole image
train is fixed with adapter rings. You also can see the wiring, which goes (with the necessary length for the focus) directly
to the upper plate.

When looking from the side you can see the two plate. The handle is in a position, where the rig is well balanced.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0120.png"/>

At the front there is the dew heater and an unihedron SQR with 20 degrees opening window on the dew shield. Due to the length
of the plate I can't slide in the dew shield anymore, but there is no need for it.

During transportation I put the wiring with a hook-and-loop tape to the rig.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0122.png"/>

At the bottom of the plate there is a clamp for two purposes: first it gives me an exact balance, when mounted. Second it's the
guarantee, that my rig does not glitch from the mount when I tighten the screws at the mount.

On the side I have a stickstation for gathering temperature and pressure for the refraction data.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0124.png"/>

The setup is connected via USB. I tried to used the best cables with adequate length. I didn't succed all the time, but I did
my best.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0125.png"/>

When starting setting up, the first step is to put the wired from outside to the pier. One is for 12V power supply (which is
in fact 13,8V) and the second one is an ethernet cable.

The other side are linked to fixed installed electrical outlets at the house.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0128.png"/>

Next step is to put the mount on top of the pier. It's the heaviest part. In the house, the mount sits on top of a tripod.
I used to port it as one pice (including the counterweight). We'll see how long I can do that :-)

Next is fixing the mount ith the screws.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0130.png"/>

I put some markers on it, which refer to the necessary commands when doing a polar align, just to know, what has to be done
right.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0131.png"/>
<img src="./pics/IMG_0132.png"/>

Ideally, the mount is leveled.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0134.png"/>

Again you can see the clamp, which i mentioned and how it works.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0135.png"/>

Next I'm fixing the wires from rig

<img src="./pics/IMG_0139.png"/>

to mount with the adaptor for the laserpointer.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0138.png"/>

After that I put the aluminium case to the base of the pier

<img src="./pics/IMG_0142.png"/>
<img src="./pics/IMG_0143.png"/>

and start to plug all wires. First external power supply and ethernet:

<img src="./pics/IMG_0144.png"/>

than the wire to the mount

<img src="./pics/IMG_0145.png"/>

and the usb interface and two switched 12V supplies. One for the electronics (camera and focuser) and one for the heater.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0146.png"/>

Next I fix the wire to the pier.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0147.png"/>
<img src="./pics/IMG_0148.png"/>

The final step is to plug the GPS receiver and start it.

<img src="./pics/IMG_0149.png"/>
<img src="./pics/IMG_0150.png"/>

waiting for GPS signal

<img src="./pics/IMG_0151.png"/>

switching on the power supply

<img src="./pics/IMG_0152.png"/>

and I'm set. The whole procedure takes my about 10 minutes for moving all stuff from the house the the permanent pier outside.
Still not to much tim, but think of the weight of the mount including the counterweights.

After that I boot the mount and start to polar align.
