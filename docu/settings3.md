## Settings for park positions

<img src="pics/tab_settings_parkpositionsconfig.png"/>

MountWizzard can slew to mount to 6 different positions in the Pointing TAB. The text of the buttons and the azimuth (AZ) and
altitude (ALT) could be set in this menue. Please think about the ranges of that values: AZ between 0 and 360 and ALT between
0 and 90. Still it might be critical to set the min / max values and please take the set altitude limits of you mount into account.
Otherwise the mount won't slew to the given point.
