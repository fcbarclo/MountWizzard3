## Analyse data window and data interpretation

### Area 1 - diagrams

In analyse window you can look on different types of diagrams and measured data. The values and the chart data is named on
the buttons. There are two types of diagrams: standard x/y diagrams and two polar diagrams.

### Area 2 - scaling

Each diagram could be scaled to fit the desired view of the user. This could be done separately for ra and dec scaling as
well for the error value. Changing scale should lead in an automatic redraw of the diagram.

### Area 3 - plotted diagram

MountWizzard differentiates the points in color to get more information about the modeled behaviour:

- green: points of east side of pier
- blue: point west side of pier

### Area 4 - title section

The title contains the filename for the data, which is shown in the diagram.
