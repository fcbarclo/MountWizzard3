a little bit easier to work for you. You find the issues under:

Please open a new issue for each problem. If you have more of them, please an issue per problem.
To be able for track them down, please add the log file from mountwizzard in any case. In beta's the loglevel

in the menu to info at least (better debug). This file could be get big

There are some more informations probably necessary this might be:
- the used configuration file, located in the config folder
