## Model Building Thoughts

First of all a disclaimer to all what I have written here:
- I only focus on model building with tool support, so no words about manual model building.
- I don't know the internal algorithms of the 10micron mount how the calculate their corrections.
So many of the hints derive from pure logical or mathematical approaches and even there I personally
might have some misconceptions or make some errors.

My setup - as I mention it as reference - is described in:
[my setup](https://github.com/mworion/MountWizzard3-DIST/blob/master/docu/setup_gear/setup_gear.md)

So my goal in model building is quite simple: I'm lazy in doing setups, so I want a solutions which
gives me a correction model most accurate in minimum of time automatically. I rely heavily on the
corrections capability on the 10micron mounts, so I use them always with dual tracking on. For doing a
setup there are many things to think of beside the model (leveling, rigidity etc.). Keep them perfect, but I
don't talk about them. So this results in two tasks I have to do to get a model to do unguided images:
Polar alignment and the model for correction itself.

### Remarks about model building from the origin: model maker

As there was (and is) ModelMaker from Per in the past (which influenced me to buy the mount)
some more solutions like ModelCreator from Martin evolved. I'm doing MountWizzard work the way like I
use it personally, but if there are ideas which should be realized, please let me know.

This said, I follow a different path in modeling for 10micron mount than in the past. There was always
the first step by using 3 base points for the start. There is no reason about that but the fact that
you need at least 3 stars to build a first model to get some information about you polar alignment etc.

I refer to the Blog Filippo Riccio from 10micron wrote:

how modeling works. Please read it carefully ! It might be to complex to understand so I will abstract
it a little bit (please forgive me if it is too simple) and add some personal experiences:

#### Polar Alignment:

- For getting a polar alignment you need in minimum 3 alignment stars.
- If you have a bad mechanical setup (leveling, etc), this might not be enough (even though you get
calculated numbers)
- If you choose the location of stars badly (to close, etc), the result will be bad, too.
- Yes, you could use more points for first model for polar alignment. Sometimes this is necessary.
In my fixed pier setup when putting the mount on top of the pier, I only have to use 3 stars to get a
reasonable result.
- Please think of the main task: you would like to do a polar alignment. Please think of the mechanics
of the orientations in the sky and remember what you would like to do. Does the choice of stars
helps or not?
- Please don't think just adding more stars for a first model to do polar alignment will result
automatically in the better result. All the hints you get from the mount (how to turn knobs, alignment
star) improve the alignment. As the model is only an approximation for the error correction, it will
be not an one step approach. If you aim for the best result, please think of 2-3 iterations of the whole
procedure. In my setup

#### Model build:

- The model correct for error. Some could be removed exactly, some not.
- The way is a mathematically optimization method.
- In max the mount could calculate 22 terms (which means two models of a set of 11 terms, one for WEST
 and one for EAST side). The algorithm of the mount chooses the numbers -> you have no influence to it !
- Sorry that's not true: from mathematics: if you need 22 parameters for the model (for whatever reason
the mount thinks), you have to have at minimum 22 alignment stars or more. Otherwise this will not
result in 22 parameters.
- Again like in polar alignment: think of what is the goal of this task. For sure you would like to
remove as much of the alignment error to be able to get unguided images.
- This said: Choose stars in the region where the mount points during the overall imaging sessions.
Stars elsewhere obviously might not help in improving your actual imaging session.
- Again this is not the whole truth. Because of mathematics optimization might lead to unstable results
if you have to narrow measurements. So some points who make a good average helps the mathematics.
- For that reason I normally do about 40 points to cover that all.

#### Model optimization:

- Yes you could remove bad points from the model.
- But does it help ? Again from mathematics: you bend an error curve like a metal plate over a rough
surface to equalize it. If the is a single stone under this plate -> approximation might be bad. So
removing this stone might help in getting a better approximation for the rest of the surface. But it
is not good to remove the gravel under the plate to improve just numbers in RMS!
- If I see large outliers in alignment errors within an area which shows good numbers around, I remove
that single point. But not to much. In average I remove 2-5 points from a 60 point model max.
- Yes if you remove a point the over RMS could rise ! That's because the whole model is newly calculated
and that's no subtraction of a bad point.

To sum it up: you have the think about your targets and don't just shoot the numbers !

#### Impact to development to MountWizzard3

I split the workflow into two parts: The Initial Model (for setup, polar alignment etc.)
and the Full Model (building the model for imaging). In addition MountWizzard3 takes care about
all topics about sync behaviour so you don't have to take care yourself. Honestly speaking MW3 uses
a different way for model build which does not need these settings.

##### Step 1

With the initial model you could do the setup, which is basically polar alignment. You could extend
this for leveling or ortho align etc.)
You are not limited to 3 stars. Beside an average distribution over the sky you could alter stars
location according to visibility or other constraints. Once you reach the performance you think it's
OK, you could go for step 2. Please consider the amount of time used against the improvements for
each additional iteration step.

If you have a setup which is stable and / or has repeatable align conditions like a fixed pier you
could omit the first step and directly start over to step 2.

##### Step 2

There were multiple choices to define the alignment stars for your model. All selections take care
of visual constraints (horizon mask) or other limitation. MountWizzard3 tries to optimize the slewing
path, order and functions in order to minimize the time for modeling. In general it should be
possible to to 45 point within 15 minutes. So doing 2-3 points more should not cause any big
time delay.

##### Step 3

Another difference you might discover: I do not build the model step by step over all the stars,
I just make all the slewing work, images and solve in parallel and than process them to the mount.
As you have all the data for a model collected, you could redo any model making session just with
the data already saved on your computer.
