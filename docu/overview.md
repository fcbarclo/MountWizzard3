## Overview
### Main Screen

MountWizzard opens of a set of windows depending on the use case you would like to follow. The main windows opens when started,
the other windows could be opened when haven the right use case. E.g. Modeling Plot Window could be opened from
["Make Mount Model"](firststeps3.md) Menue, the Analyse Window could be opened from ["Model Analyse"](firststeps5.md). MountWizzard
saves the status of the windows. So once opened, after the next start windows will automatically opened accordingly. MountWizzard
stores the positions of the windows as well.

There is one topic to take care of: the gui can't react on different DPI resolution settings in windows environment. Please keep them
to 100% as default, otherwise length of texts etc. might not fit in the surrounding boxes. Sorry for that, but it's a bunch of work
to make this happen, and there is roughly any strong request for it.

First, there is the main screen:
