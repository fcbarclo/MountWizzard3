class Connection(object):
    """
    The class Command provides the command and reply interface to a 10 micron mount.
    There should be all commands and their return values be sent to the mount via
    IP and the responses parsed accordingly.

    Define the number of chunks for the return bytes in case of not having them in
    bulk mode this is needed, because the mount computer  doesn't support a
    transaction base like number of chunks to be expected. It's just plain data and
    I have to find out myself how much it is. there are three types of commands:

          a) no reply               this is ok -> COMMAND_A
          b) reply without '#'      this is the bad part, don't like it -> COMMAND_B
          c) reply ended with '#'   this is normal feedback -> no special treatment

    The class itself need parameters for the host and port to be able to interact
    with the mount. In addition it needs classes, where the settings, firmware and
    site parameters are handled.
